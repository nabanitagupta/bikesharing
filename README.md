Des Moine vs. NY City Bikeshare

The pie chart illustrates the distribution of gender in NYC, which is similar to Des Moines, Iowa. This served as the basis for 
further exploration and led to the bar chart analysis.

NYC Bike Data trip duration bar chart indicates that the usage has stabilized and may be increasing slightly over time. 
Des Moines has a similar demographic profile from several vantage points most noticeably the percentage of millennials and gender 
Distribution. This indicates that the two cities are correctable and suggests that Des Moines deserves serious consideration
as a bike sharing business location.

There is a higher volume of business in the central business districts of NY such as downtown Manhattan vs. the boroughs, and although
tourists do rent, they represent a mere sliver of activity as compared to city dwellers. This equates to Des Moines which has a stable, year round population and does not rely on tourism to support outdoor activities.

The bike utilization circular graph illustrates that maintenance
costs are low and we hold similar expectations for Des Moines cost of doing business.

Des Moines seems like a worthy candidate for further research and shows potential for a profitable bike sharing business location.
